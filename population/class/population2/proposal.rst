1.	Problem Statement
1.1	Introduction 
               Given US Census Bureau dataset for 2010, We will pre-process the data and store it in Apache Hadoop and using data mining algorithms we will identify the population density shifts in ZCTA’s (Zip Code Tabulation Areas) and how it relates to the unemployment rates in the area. We will also create dashboards for displaying concentrations using different visualization techniques.
